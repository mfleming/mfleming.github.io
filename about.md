Hi, I'm Matt. I'm the Linux kernel EFI co-maintainer and a performance
engineer at [SUSE Labs](http://www.suse.com). This is my blog where I
talk about software engineering things, the Linux kernel, performance
analysis and pretty much anything to do with open source software.

If you want to get in touch, please feel free to [drop me an
email](mailto:{{ site.email %}}).

All opinions and comments on these pages are my own.
