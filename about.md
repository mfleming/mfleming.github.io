I'm Matt Fleming, a Senior Performance Engineer at
[SUSE](http://www.suse.com), and the Linux Kernel EFI co-maintainer.

I'm also a [freelance writer]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing/). I've
written for some of the [biggest names](http://www.intel.com) in the
[enterprise](http://www.suse.com) tech industry, and created clean
content that made complex topics accessible. You can find samples of
my work on the [writing page]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing/).

If you want to get in touch, please feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:{{
site.email }}).
