I'm Matt Fleming. I'm a Senior Performance Engineer at
[SUSE](http://www.suse.com), and the Linux Kernel EFI co-maintainer.
This is my blog where I talk about software engineering things, the
Linux Kernel, performance analysis, and pretty much anything to do
with open source software.

I'm also a [freelance writer]({{ site.baseurl }}/writing/). My niche
is long-form technical content that makes complex topics accessible.
It's the kind of writing that's great for SEO and showcasing company
expertise.

If you want to get in touch, please feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:{{
site.email }}).

All opinions on these pages are my own.
