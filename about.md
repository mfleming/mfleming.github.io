I'm Matt Fleming, a founder and software consultant. I work on low-level and high-performance systems such as the Linux kernel, distributed databases (Apache Cassandra), and event streaming platforms (Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar). I also do a lot of benchmarking and performance analysis and co-wrote a paper on automating analysis using [change point detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03034).
