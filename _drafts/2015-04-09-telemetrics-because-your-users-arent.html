The downside of client-side software is that you don't get any feedback from the initial impression users have with your software. The biggest concern is that you're turning potential users away at the first hurdle. They are extremely unlikely to tell you why they're unhappy with your product because they're not invested.<br /><br />Things are different for longer-term users, particularly if they're using your product as a daily part of their lives.<br /><br />The way that most products get around this hurdle is with the use of telemetrics.
