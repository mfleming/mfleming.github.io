Throughout my professional career I've often heard the idiom "Don't reinvent the wheel" in discussions and debates. It wouldn't be such a well-known phrase if there wasn't some utility in it, but it isn't always as sagelike as it might first appear.<br /><br />Taking it to heart can dissuade programmers from thinking of new, innovative solutions to existing problems.<br /><br /><br /><br />As a starting point, yes, absolutely go and look at how your particular problem has been solved before. But if none of them are good enough (and it's not possible to make them so) don't be afraid from starting a new project to solve your problem.
