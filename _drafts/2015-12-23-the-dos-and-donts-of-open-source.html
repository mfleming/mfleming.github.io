A lot of people are doing open source wrong. Submitting your patches or getting them committed to an open source project is not the end of the development process. The commit message needs to be clear and descriptive.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Kick-starting the ecosystem</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">People fix your bugs</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Stronger Together</span><br />Having multiple people working on a single task<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Patch Quality</span><br />Open source projects last for many, many years - the Linux kernel is over 23 years old, and commit history going back to 2005. Your commits are frozen in time. And because developers are going to be referring to your patches and because they can't just pickup the phone, or bump into you at the water cooler, they need to be super descriptive.<br /><br />Linus Torvalds is master of the quality commit message.<br /><br />Don't hide the warts of your patch. If you have made a change that is controversial, or likely to cause a lot of discussion, call that out in your patch message. *Be explicit* List tradeoffs of the approach along with why you chose to go for the one that you did.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Don't make decisions behind closed doors</span><br />There's a reason that successful open source projects use mailing lists - it's where major decisions get made. All members get to chime in with their 2 cents, no one gets left out.
