<div>Last month I got a report from one of SUSE's QA teams that
writev(2) performance had regressed between Linux kernel v3.12 and
v4.4 as reported by the libmicro microbenchmark. libmicro tests a
number of file-related system calls and the writev_t1k test had
regressed about 16.12%. On the QA machine, v3.12 was showing a mean
latency of 3.7usec and v4.4 about 4.2usec.</div><br /><div>What
follows is an account of the steps I took and thought processes I went
through when investigating this report. This article is mainly
intended to be a record that I can review in the future, but other
people might find it interesting too.<br /><br /></div><div>For me,
the first step in any performance investigation is reproduction.
Secondly, validating the scenarios under which the regression occurs
and whether those conditions are reasonable -- for example, if a
misconfigured benchmark shows a regression, does anyone really
care?</div><h2>Reproduction</h2><div>I grabbed the code that the QA
team use for running libmicro and logged into one of their v4.4
machines exhibiting the problem. I then re-ran the benchmark with the
exact parameters from the report,<br /><br />

{% highlight bash %}
  ./bin/writev -E -C 2000 -L -S -W -N "writev_t1k" -s 1k -v 10 -f /tmp/data
{% endhighlight %}

I actually ran it multiple times, out of habit. Doing this gives a
good indication of run-to-run variability and whether the reported
regression was simply a case of hitting an unlucky run.<br /><br
/></div><div>Incidentally, the first time I ran the code on v4.4 I got
the same result as Linux v3.12. Running it a few more times hit the
regressed numbers in the report, so something non-deterministic was
clearly going on.</div><h2>Validation</h2><div>Having reproduced the
issue, the next step was to figure out whether the libmicro results
were expected/sensible or misleading. Was something misconfigured? Can
we *trust* the data?<br /><br /></div><div>I chose to verify the
results libmicro was reporting with another tool. In this case, ftrace
and the syscall tracepoints.</div><br /><blockquote>Sidebar: Brendan Gregg's
textbook "Systems Performance: Enterprise and Cloud" has a handy tip
about cross-validation and using tools to test other tools. Sometimes
having multiple ways of doing something can be an
advantage.</blockquote><div>You can use the sys_writev_enter and
sys_writev_exit tracepoints to individually measure how long the
writev(2) syscall took like so,<br /><br />

{% highlight bash %}
  for sys in sys_writev_enter sys_writev_exit; do
    echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/${sys}/enable
  done
{% endhighlight %}

The output from /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace will look similar
to,<br /><br />

{% highlight bash %}
writev-23314 [002] ...1 705193.737900: sys_writev(fd: 3, vec: 1e800c0, vlen: a)
writev-23314 [002] ...1 705193.737904: sys_writev -> 0x2800
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can use awk or any other glue language to workout duration
from consecutive timestamps, and then use those durations to calculate
the mean for yourself.</div><div><br /><blockquote>This is a bug bear of mine - when benchmarks do not dump the samples   they used to calculate averages. Depending on the context, you may   want to manually calculate different statistics, like percentiles or   the median. Using a single mean value also prohibits you from seeing   patterns in the data.</blockquote></div><div>Averages reported by libmicro looked roughly accurate when compared with those in the report, given that libmicro cannot measure the durations as accurately as ftrace.</div><h2>Analysis</h2><div>At this point, it's important to dig a little deeper into any patterns that emerge from the individual durations.</div><div>The first thing I did was sort the times, into non-increasing order, with the highest latency first, for each of the multiple runs I performed.<br /><br /></div><div>Those runs with a higher average (worse latency) had more individual higher latencies, but no astronomically large latencies. Which implies that the cause of the high latency wasn't some singular event - writev calls sometimes just took longer.<br /><br /></div><div>A large latency, or outlier, would skew the mean value and could be the cause of the differences in mean between kernel versions. But that clearly wasn't happening here.<br /><br /></div><div>I looked at the raw traces gathered above and tried to match up high latencies with a timestamp. I noticed that the higher latencies usually occurred at the beginning of the run (7 or 8 microseconds). With the latencies at the end always being around 3 or 4 microseconds.<br /><br /></div><div>At this point, I assumed there were some oddities in the startup of libmicro. 2000 samples were collected by libmicro and so it was natural to print the mean of 500 samples at the following intervals, 0-500, 500-1000, 1000-1500, 1500-2000.<br />
<br />

{% highlight bash %}
  for i in 500 1000 1500 2000; do
        cat /tmp/trace | head -n$i | tail -n500
  done
{% endhighlight %}

Doing that for 3 runs shows the trend. The last two samples have a
mean of 3-4 and the first two chunks vary.<br /><br />

{% highlight bash %}
writev_t1k reported mean: 6.17776
 500: mean 6.018us median 6us
1000: mean 5.172us median 5us
1500: mean 5.048us median 5us
2000: mean 3.918us median 4us

writev_t1k reported mean: 5.64197
 500: mean 6.254us median 6us
1000: mean 5.038us median 6us
1500: mean 3.526us median 4us
2000: mean 3.608us median 4us

writev_t1k reported mean: 4.33704
 500: mean 3.528us median 3us
1000: mean 3.486us median 3us
1500: mean 3.518us median 3us
2000: mean 3.492us median 3us
{% endhighlight %}

Had I graphed the latencies straight away, these startup effects would have been obvious from the start. Hypothetically, it would have looked something like this,

<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g4ZeUL5ZVu8/WB5kahD-BUI/AAAAAAAAFJk/0gCRAP_wlW8av4diumQw44rNXez3u-VHQCLcB/s1600/syscall.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-g4ZeUL5ZVu8/WB5kahD-BUI/AAAAAAAAFJk/0gCRAP_wlW8av4diumQw44rNXez3u-VHQCLcB/s400/syscall.png" width="400" /></a>

</div><div>Looking at the trace again with the function graph tracer didn't show any particular hotspots. Simply, functions took, roughly, 50% less time by the end of the run than at the start including such key kernel functions as raw_spin_lock().

</div><div>It was looking extremely likely that caching effects were the cause of the regression - the functions execute more quickly as the cache warmed.

</div><div>I quickly checked to see whether libmicro was subject to excessive scheduler migrations using,
<br /><br />
{% highlight bash %}
  perf stat -e migrations -- ./libmicro <args>
{% endhighlight %}

</div>But only saw 4 migrations for the whole test. Note that like most benchmark suites libmicro forks individual tests, and the scheduler will usually try to balance tasks on fork() which can be the cause of migrations for new tasks. 
<h2>Conclusion</h2><div>I didn't dig any deeper into the scheduler migrations, even if they were likely to be the source of the different libmicro results between v3.12 and v4.4.

</div><div>If the scheduler is moving newly forked tasks to a new CPU in v4.4, and didn't in v3.12, that hardly seemed like a bug. Sure, if I'd seen hundreds or thousands of migrations occurring during the earliest parts of the libmicro test, that would warrant investigation. But it wasn't.

</div><div>Instead, the most pragmatic solution was to suggest that the QA team switch from sample-based to duration-based testing, which can help mitigate any startup effects (such as the CPU caches being cold) - it's unclear whether 2000 samples avoids cache issues, it's much more obvious that running for 10 seconds does.</div><div>
Switching the libmicro arguments from -C 2000 (samples) to -D 2000
(duration) showed system call latencies in v4.4 that matched v3.12,
