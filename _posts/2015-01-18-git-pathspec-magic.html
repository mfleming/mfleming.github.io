I am constantly surprised by the number of features provided by git.
This week, while trying to figure out how to list the commits
from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/01org/luv-yocto">Linux
UEFI Validation project</a>&nbsp;that are not part of the meta-luv
layer and also not part of upstream Poky, I came across a useful trick
on <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/21079437">stackoverflow</a>&nbsp;-<a
href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/ef79b1f8704668a6cdf4278f9255e03ca785bfb4">
git pathspec magic</a>.<br /><br />Commits not inside meta-luv and not
sent to Poky represent the technical debt for the LUV project. Ideally
the only changes we make outside of the meta-luv layer would also be
sent upstream. That's not always possible, so at the very least, we
need a way of finding those changes to track them.<br /><br />The
trick goes like this... If you want to list all commits apart from
those relating to a particular subdirectory, use the ":exclude"
pathspec magic,<br /><br />
{% highlight bash %}
  git log -- . ":(exclude)directory"
{% endhighlight %}

This is superb for the LUV project because most of the project's significant changes are in the meta-luv directory, which is a separate layer hosted on <a href="http://git.yoctoproject.org/">git.yoctoproject.org</a>. What we want to find is those commits that are not part of meta-luv.<br /><br />To recap, the way to display just those commits that are not part of upstream Poky dora release is,<br /><br />
{% highlight bash %}
  git log poky/dora..HEAD
{% endhighlight %}

But the resultant list of commits includes those that are part of the meta-luv layer. We don't want those commits, we just want to see those that are not part of the meta-luv layer and not part of Poky. <br /><br />The trick goes like this, <br /><br />

{% highlight bash %}
  git log poky/dora..HEAD -- . ":(exclude)meta-luv"
{% endhighlight %}

Pathspecs can be applied to all git commands that deal with paths, though documentation for git pathspecs isn't actually easy to find. You won't find it as part of the <cite>git-log</cite> man page. The best bet is to take a look at <cite>gitglossary</cite>, 
<br /><br />
<pre><br />       pathspec<br />           Pattern used to limit paths in Git commands.<br /> <br />           ...<br /><br />           A pathspec that begins with a colon : has special meaning. In the<br />           short form, the leading colon : is followed by zero or more "magic<br />           signature" letters (which optionally is terminated by another colon<br />           :), and the remainder is the pattern to match against the path.<br /><br />           ...<br /><br />           exclude<br />               After a path matches any non-exclude pathspec, it will be run<br />               through all exclude pathspec (magic signature: !). If it<br />               matches, the path is ignored.<br /></pre>
